                Hi, I am Mary-Jayne and some of my favorite cases are the
                Jeffery Dahmer case and the Menendez Brothers case, I started
                getting into true crime after discovering the cruel story of
                Jeffery Dahmer. His cruel crimes and the twisted story behind
                them fascinated me. Since then i've been hooked on discovering
                new crime cases. I'm excited to dive in these murder mysteries
                with you, ready to crack these cases with us on What Was The
                Reason!!!

            <p>
              Hiya! I am Donna and some cases I find interesting are The Albert
              Fish Case and The Junko Furuta Case, I started getting into true
              crime after discovering some amazing YouTubers during the COVID
              lock-down. It wasn't something I was "into" before, but just
              hearing some of these cases meant I wanted to watch more!

            <p>
              Hi, I am Sara and some of my favorite cases are the Jeffrey Dahmer
              case and the unsolved case of Keneka Jenkins, I started getting
              into true crime after discovering true crime on socials, which was
              around 2017. Ever since then ive been invested into crime cases,
              especially cold cases and sometimes also conspiracy theories.
